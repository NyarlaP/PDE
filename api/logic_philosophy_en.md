### PDE ↔ Logic / Philosophy Interface (logic_philosophy_en)

This file is an English companion to `api/logic_philosophy.md`.  
It distinguishes **references from other disciplines** (concepts PDE borrows) from **output topics toward other fields** (how PDE engages logic and philosophy).

---

### References from other disciplines

Concepts used by this interface are listed in `api/references_en.md`. Here:

- **Gödel’s incompleteness theorems** → PDE’s L/G hierarchy, basis vectors and “ever‑ascending ladder”.
- **Limit / paradox encapsulation** → treating the undecidable by re-encoding it as axioms at a higher level.

### Output topics toward other fields

Main bridges to explore:

- **Gödel’s incompleteness theorems**  
  ↔ PDE’s L/G hierarchy, basis vectors and “ever‑ascending ladder”.  
  PDE leans heavily on the idea that each logical level has unavoidable Gödel sentences and that these often get re‑absorbed as axioms at higher levels.

- **Tao Te Ching (Dao, “having and not‑having”, reversal as the movement of Dao)**  
  ↔ PDE’s language about fractal “Dao”, virtual volume, and paradox as engine.  
  Many PDE motifs (void as functional, two from one, reversal, etc.) can be seen as a technically sharpened re‑encoding of classical Daoist themes.

- **Existentialism (Camus, Sartre, …)**  
  ↔ PDE’s “original paradox drive” and structured response to nihilism.  
  Where classical existentialism often stops at literary description of absurdity and revolt, PDE tries to give these a structural / logical model.

- **Nihilism and fatalism**  
  ↔ PDE’s stance that “unknowable fate is, for observers, equivalent to non‑existence” and “probability = a boundary of computational power”.

### TODO (for future work)

- For each major tradition, write dedicated sections with:
  - key quotes / theses from canonical texts;  
  - side‑by‑side comparison with PDE claims;  
  - a short list of “compatibilities, conflicts, and PDE’s new bets”.
- Where possible, turn hand‑wavy parallels into more formal correspondences (e.g. mapping certain PDE constructions to specific logics, type theories, or modal frameworks).
