### PDE ↔ Computing / AI Interface (cs_ai_en)

This file is an English companion to `api/cs_ai.md`.  
It distinguishes **references from other disciplines** (concepts PDE borrows) from **output topics toward other fields** (contact points with CS and AI).

---

### References from other disciplines

Concepts used by this interface are listed in `api/references_en.md`. Here:

- **Gödel’s incompleteness theorems** → L/G hierarchy, undecidable propositions, “truth encapsulated as higher-level axioms”, and their correspondence to recursive/self-modifying systems.
- **Limit / paradox encapsulation** → metaphor of packaging the undecidable or paradox into callable interfaces.
- **Recursion / infinite levels** → existing formalisms such as recursive functions, stacks, Turing machines, Gödel machines.

---

### Output topics toward other fields

Themes and directions:

- **Recursive virtual surfaces and infinite levels**  
  ↔ recursive functions, stacks, Turing machines, Gödel machines, self‑modifying systems.  
  PDE’s imagery of infinite L/G levels and recursive virtual surfaces can be read as a high‑level metaphor for certain computability and recursion‑theoretic phenomena.

- **Truth “encapsulated as API”**  
  ↔ abstraction barriers, black‑box libraries, interfaces.  
  The idea that many “truths” are really packaged paradox‑handling routines matches how software hides complexity behind stable APIs.

- **Humans as “paradox engines / God’s endoscopes”**  
  ↔ sources of preferences and value in AI alignment, complex reward modelling.  
  PDE suggests that human cognition is currently the highest‑grade module for ingesting paradox and generating new structure in meaning‑space.

- **PDE‑style system prompts / agent personas**  
  ↔ practical LLM and multi‑agent design.  
  There is room for experimenting with prompts or agent architectures that explicitly model paradox, multi‑level reasoning and “basis‑vector management” rather than pretending to resolve everything at a single level.

---

### TODO

- Extract and condense the most relevant parts of the longer philosophical / AI dialogues into:
  - a few reusable prompt templates;  
  - sketches for agents that treat paradox explicitly (e.g. tagging, routing, escalation between levels).
- Explore whether PDE can inform abstract models of:
  - how agents represent conflicting goals / values;  
  - how they choose between “encapsulating a paradox” vs “trying to resolve it”.
