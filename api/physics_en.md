### PDE ↔ Physics Interface (physics_en)

This file is an English companion to `api/physics.md`.  
It distinguishes **references from other disciplines** (concepts PDE borrows) from **output topics toward other fields** (connections or conflicts with physics).

### References from other disciplines

Concepts used by this interface are listed in `api/references_en.md`. Here:

- **Hilbert space / wave function** → analogy with virtual volume, phase, and “second collapse”.
- **Quantum probability (amplitudes, density matrices)** → extension of probability at the observation and meaning layers.
- **Fibre bundle** → base + fibre geometry (and possible bundle-over-spacetime structures).

### Output topics toward other fields

Themes and contact points:

- **Fractal universe, finite volume / infinite boundary**  
  ↔ cosmological expansion, entropy increase, voids such as the KBC void.  
  PDE treats the universe as something like a high‑dimensional fractal with conserved “volume” but ever‑more intricate boundary.

- **Spin and 1+1=2**  
  ↔ quantum spin, symmetry breaking.  
  The reading of \(1+1=2\) as a packaged paradox about “sameness vs difference” is loosely echoed in how quantum numbers distinguish otherwise identical particles.

- **Time = phase difference**  
  ↔ arrow of time, thermodynamic time, quantum phase.  
  Time is rephrased as the phase difference between material→meaning and meaning→material mappings, which invites comparison with phase‑based descriptions in quantum mechanics.

- **Virtual volume / virtual surfaces**  
  ↔ hidden variables, Hilbert space, wave functions, perhaps fibre‑bundle structures over spacetime.

### TODO (for future contributors)

- Separate the current analogies into:
  - relationships that **could in principle be made mathematically precise**, vs.  
  - purely metaphorical / heuristic parallels.
- For the first category, spell out:
  - candidate formalisms (e.g. specific fractal models, bundle constructions, open quantum systems, …);  
  - clear falsification criteria or tension points with mainstream physics (dark energy interpretation, entropy bounds, Planck‑scale structure, etc.).
