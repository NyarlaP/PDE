### PDE – Narrative Hooks and Metaphors (narrative_stories_en)

English companion to `interfaces/narrative_stories.md`.  
This file is meant as a **staging area for fiction ideas, metaphors and narrative frames** that express PDE intuitions.

---

### Intended contents

- Core metaphors such as:
  - “God’s endoscope” (humans as internal sensors of a larger structure);  
  - “finite volume, infinite boundary” (Koch‑style universe);  
  - “points as flattened spin” (no true points, only compressed dynamics).
- Story seeds and settings:
  - short or long‑form fiction where characters grapple with paradox engines, Gödel staircases, virtual volume, etc.;  
  - SF worlds where PDE is taken as in‑universe physics or metaphysics.

---

### TODO

- Distil 2–3 of the most promising story ideas from the conversations into short English summaries;  
- gradually expand those summaries into outlines or standalone pieces.
