### PDE – Long‑form Essay for Human Readers (philosophy_essay_en)

This file is an English companion / placeholder corresponding to `interfaces/philosophy_essay.md`.  
The **primary long‑form manifesto is currently written in Chinese** in `interfaces/哲学白皮书.md`, with a shorter English whitepaper in `interfaces/philosophy_whitepaper_en.md`.

The eventual purpose of this file:

- to host a **full‑length English essay** version of PDE that can stand on its own;  
- to provide multiple length variants (short abstract, mid‑length overview, extended essay);  
- to serve as a structural template if other language versions are added.

Until that is written, readers are encouraged to:

- read the main English README and `interfaces/philosophy_whitepaper_en.md` for a compact overview;  
- use a language model to assist with reading the Chinese whitepaper if deeper narrative detail is needed.
