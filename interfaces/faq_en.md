### PDE – FAQ (English companion)

English companion to `interfaces/faq.md`.  
This file will collect **frequently asked questions and short answers** about PDE for an English‑speaking audience.

---

### Example questions to address

- How does PDE relate to traditional existentialism / nihilism?  
- Is PDE “science”? Can it be falsified in any meaningful sense?  
- Why take paradox seriously instead of treating it as a mere curiosity or error?  
- How does PDE interact with religion (especially atheism, pan‑theism, Daoism)?  
- Should AI systems “understand” PDE? Would that make them safer or more dangerous?

### TODO

- Extract ready‑made answers from existing notes and conversations, translate / adapt them into concise English Q&A;  
- keep a balance between accessibility and technical depth, linking to `core/` and `interfaces/` where appropriate.
