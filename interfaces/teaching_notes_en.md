### PDE – Teaching / Talk Notes (teaching_notes_en)

English companion to `interfaces/teaching_notes.md`.  
This file is meant to host **outlines and notes for talks, seminars or study groups** about PDE.

---

### Planned uses

- Design talk / course structures for different audiences:
  - mathematically inclined readers (focus on logic, geometry, probability);  
  - physics / complex systems audiences;  
  - philosophy / humanities audiences;  
  - general readers.
- Capture slide decks, speaking notes or reading lists once such events are actually run.

---

### TODO

- Based on the current `draft.md` and core files, sketch a 3–5 session mini‑course in English;  
- align the structure with the Chinese teaching notes so both languages evolve together.
