### PDE Roadmap / TODO (English companion)

This file is an English companion to `docs/roadmap.md`.  
It tracks **what to build next**, both on the core side and on the applications / formalisation side.

---

### What this page is for

- listing **high‑priority “infrastructure” tasks** in `core/`;  
- collecting **formalisation / application directions** that would be good entry points for collaborators;  
- keeping a rough **milestone log** (what’s drafted, what’s stabilising, what’s still only a hunch).

---

### Suggested structure (to be filled)

Eventually, tasks and open problems can be grouped into at least four clusters:

1. **Mathematical foundations**  
   - Make the dual‑space, L/G hierarchy, paradox‑axis and virtual volume ideas precise in one or more existing frameworks (set theory, category theory, model theory, type theory, …).  
   - Identify the strongest impossibility / inconsistency results that would rule out some PDE claims.

2. **Physics / cosmology**  
   - Clarify how far the “finite volume, infinite boundary, fractal universe” metaphor can be pushed within current cosmology and statistical physics.  
   - Extract falsifiable predictions or clear conflict points (e.g. dark energy interpretation, Planck‑scale structure, entropy bounds).

3. **Social science / AI applications**  
   - Turn CASM (Complex‑Analysis Social Model) into a minimal, testable definition.  
   - Build toy experiments: real or public data → complex signal → phase plots / residues.  
   - Explore PDE‑style AI agent prompts / multi‑agent paradox‑handling schemes.

4. **Philosophical interpretation and pedagogy**  
   - Systematically map PDE to existing traditions (existentialism, Taoism, analytic metaphysics…) with points of agreement and conflict.  
   - Design talk / course outlines that make the framework approachable for different audiences.

For now, this file is a placeholder; concrete issues and milestones can be added as the project stabilises.
