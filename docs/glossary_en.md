### PDE Glossary (English companion)

This file is an English companion to `docs/glossary.md`.  
It is meant to collect short, working definitions of key terms that recur throughout the project.

At the moment it is only a **skeleton**; proper entries should be filled in as the core texts stabilise.

---

Planned entries include (at least):

- **Paradox axis**  
  Roughly: the continuum of statements / situations that resist clean True/False labelling under any fixed language or logic; each theory “cuts out” a measurable subset of this axis.

- **Meaning space / material space**  
  Two orthogonal but coupled domains: one for things/energy/infrastructure, one for relations/values/credit/identity; PDE treats them like the real and imaginary axes of a complex plane.

- **Virtual volume / virtual surface / fibre**  
  The higher‑dimensional structure attached to each base‑space point; operationally, what we actually “grab” when we pick a point, number or state.

- **L predicate, Gi / Li operators**  
  \(\mathsf{L}_i(x)\): “\(x\) is unprovable in level \(L_i\)”;  
  \(G_i\): truth‑observation at level \(L_i\);  
  \(L_i\): the \(i\)-th layer logic in the Gödel staircase.

- **Basis vectors (as encapsulated paradox)**  
  Axioms / primitive notions that are, in PDE’s view, frozen remnants of earlier paradoxes; necessary to run the system but not fully justifiable inside it.

- **Spin, and the 1+1=2 “primordial paradox”**  
  The idea that \(1+1=2\) hides a tension between sameness and difference, resolved by an underlying “spin” that keeps two 1s from collapsing into one or drifting apart completely.

- **Recursive virtual surfaces, double collapse (probability → statistics)**  
  The picture of infinitely recursive virtual dynamics first collapsing into probabilistic clouds, then into macro‑level statistical laws.

As the project evolves, these stubs should be turned into precise, internally consistent entries, with cross‑links to the relevant `core/` files.
