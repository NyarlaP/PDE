### PDE Overview (English companion)

This file is an English companion to `docs/overview.md`.  
It is meant as a **bird’s‑eye view** of the PDE project and a pointer into the rest of the repository.

### What PDE is, in one paragraph

PDE (Paradox‑Driven Existentialism) is an open framework that tries to rewrite the relation between **existence, meaning and paradox** using tools from modern logic, physics, complex analysis and complex systems.  
It is not a finished theory but a structured collection of **conjectures, architectural sketches and proto‑models** that are intended to be formalised, implemented, attacked and extended.

### The core picture

A minimal mental model to carry while navigating the repo:

- **Two spaces** – a material/existence space \(\mathcal{M}\) and a meaning/intentional space \(\mathcal{E}\), orthogonal but coupled.  
- **Paradox axis** – whenever we compress reality with a fixed language/logic, awkward edge‑cases line up into a fuzzy “paradox axis”; languages are ways of cutting measurable subsets from this axis.  
- **L/G hierarchy (Gödel staircase)** – each logical level \(L_i\) has undecidable sentences; from \(L_{i+1}\) these become basis vectors / axioms; there is no accessible final level \(L_\infty\).  
- **Points and virtual volume** – points are projections of higher‑dimensional fibres; we interact with their virtual volume rather than with bare coordinates.  
- **Probability and time** – probability arises from coarse‑graining infinitely recursive spin; time is the phase difference between material→meaning and meaning→material mappings.  
- **Life / humans / AI** – currently observed as the highest‑grade “paradox engines”, entities that ingest paradox and reorganise meaning‑space.

- For **applications and experiments**:  
  see `apps/credit_complex_analysis/`, `apps/quantum_stats/`, `apps/fate_bazi_dynamics/`, `apps/ai_alignment/`, `apps/paradox_cases/`.
- For **human‑facing texts** (essays, stories, teaching notes):  
  see the files under `interfaces/`, plus the Chinese whitepaper and its English companion `interfaces/philosophy_whitepaper_en.md`.

This overview is intentionally brief; the main README and whitepaper go into more narrative detail.
