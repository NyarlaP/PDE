### Quantum‑Flavoured Statistics Framework – Notes (English companion)

English companion to `apps/quantum_stats/model_notes.md`.  
This file is for notes on rebuilding parts of statistics on **quantum probability and phase structure**, guided by PDE.

---

### Goals

- Replace classical sample‑space intuitions with **Hilbert‑space / density‑matrix** language where appropriate.  
- Bring in interference terms, non‑commuting measurements and order effects to model context‑dependence in real‑world data (social, behavioural, economic, etc.).  
- Give a more precise mathematical home to the PDE slogan  
  “probability = ignorance of infinitely recursive phase”.

---

### TODO

- Extract from the philosophical notes a **candidate axiom set** for a minimal quantum‑style statistics system in this spirit;  
- build at least one small toy example (e.g. a two‑state system with order effects) and work it through in detail.
