### Complex‑Analysis Credit Model (CASM) – Examples (English companion)

English companion to `apps/credit_complex_analysis/examples.md`.  
This file is meant to host **worked examples and small experiments** for CASM.

---

### Planned content

- Hand‑drawn or simulated trajectories of “idealised agents” in the complex plane:
  - e.g. conservative saver vs. speculative trader vs. fraudulent scheme;  
  - see how their paths differ in modulus and argument over time.
- Small experiments with real or synthetic time series:
  - data (e.g. a balance or index) → analytic signal via Hilbert transform → complex trajectory;  
  - visualise phase portraits, detect spiral‑out behaviour near poles.

### TODO

- Start with 1–2 tiny case studies, focusing on clarity rather than realism;  
- document the pipeline from raw data to complex trajectory and interpretation.
