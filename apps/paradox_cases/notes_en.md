### Paradox Case Library – Notes (English companion)

English companion to `apps/paradox_cases/notes.md`.  
This file is intended to host **PDE‑style re‑analyses of specific paradoxes**.

---

### Candidate cases

- The edge between change and non‑change (continuity vs. discreteness).  
- The arrow of time.  
- Classical logical paradoxes: liar, barber, Russell‑style sets, etc.  
- Zero‑measure events, infinitesimals, Zeno’s paradoxes.  
- Fate vs. freedom, framed through the Gödel staircase.

### Suggested format per paradox

For each case:

1. **Classical statement** – how the paradox is usually phrased.  
2. **Standard resolutions / interpretations** – what mainstream logic / philosophy / physics says.  
3. **PDE version** – how the paradox looks when expressed in dual‑space, L/G, virtual‑volume language;  
   which parts are encapsulated as basis vectors, which remain open.
