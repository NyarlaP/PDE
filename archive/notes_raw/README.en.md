### archive/notes_raw (English companion)

This directory is intended as a **scratchpad** for temporary notes, fragments and unstructured drafts.

- Anything placed here is assumed to be *provisional* and may later be:
  - promoted into `core/`, `api/`, `apps/` or `interfaces/` after being cleaned up;  
  - or discarded if it turns out not to be useful.

The Chinese `README.md` in this directory carries the same message; this file is its brief English counterpart.
